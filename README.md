Major Project - Face Mask Detection.

During the covid-19 times, we have implemented a automatic face mask detection system using Artificial Intelligence. We have used the tools like OpenCv, Haar Cascade Classifier, 
TensorFlow, Jupyter Notebook and in-built laptop camera to detect the face mask.

Haar Cascade Classifier is used to detect the facial features of humans. Based on this we have detected if the mask is present or not on the face with good accuracy.
